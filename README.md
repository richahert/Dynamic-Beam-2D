## Dynamic-Beam-2D

This is a simplified version of the example in Chapter 2.7 of "Numerical Tours of Continuum Mechanics" by Jeremy Bleyer.
It can be run in a Jupyter Notebook with FEniCS installed.

This example is the Baseline for a FSI Simulation where FEniCS is coupled with OpenFOAM via preCICE.
